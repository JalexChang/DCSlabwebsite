		"name" :"Research and development of cloud storage access gateway",
		"description" :"Cloud storage services (CSSs) such as Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft’s OneDrive are more and more popular. For users, they can access and store their data through the Internet at any time and at anywhere. On the other hand, web service providers can reduce their costs on devices storage by using CSSs’ API to access users’ cloud storages and managing their data indirectly. Although this method is convenient, it still a problem that each CSS has its own connection method of cloud storage’s API and WSPs must spend additional time understanding them for operating and development.<br>In this project, we try to propose a CDMI-compliant cloud storage access gateway to integrate different APIs of CSSs.",
